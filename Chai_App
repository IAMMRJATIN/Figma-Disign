5 Hours, One Stunning Figma Design! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
What happens when passion meets design? You create something youâ€™re proud of! 
ðŸ’¡Inspiration?
This weekend, A stunning Instagram post by @creative_vaani sparked the idea, and I decided to bring my own twist to it. I dedicated 5 hours to designing this UI/UX concept for a Chai Ordering App â€“ blending aesthetics with usability. â˜•ðŸŽ¨

ðŸ”¥ Key Features:
 âœ… A visually engaging, user-friendly interface
 âœ… Smooth navigation for a seamless chai-ordering experience
 âœ… Modern typography and an earthy color scheme that enhances the brand vibe
From brainstorming to execution, every detail in this design reflects my love for UI/UX and problem-solving. ðŸ’»

ðŸ’¡ Would love to hear your feedback!
